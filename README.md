# TidalSwift

Tidal Music Streaming Client & Library written in Swift

It supports all major features of the official Tidal app, while adding additional ones, like New Releases, Lyrics, Dark Mode, Downloads & Offline Playback – all while being only 1/10th the size of the official app.




## Impressions

### New Releases

Unlike the official Tidal app, TidalSwift can display new releases by your favorite artists.

### Lyrics

Also, unlike the official app, it can display the Lyrics of the currently playing song.

### Offline

This is a big one. The official desktop app still doesn't support offline playback – and probably never will. This app does!

### Downloads

It even goes a step further. You can download music to your hard drive and do with it whatever you want.
